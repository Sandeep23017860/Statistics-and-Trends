This report aims to conduct an exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) on the Kaggle "Car Prices 
Dataset". This dataset encompasses information 
related to various attributes of cars, including their 
respective prices. Through this analysis, our aim 
is to uncover insightful patterns and trends within 
the data, thereby gaining a better understanding 
of the factors influencing car prices.

The descriptive statistics provide a 
comprehensive summary of key characteristics 
across five columns in the car prices dataset. 
Firstly, the "year" column spans from 2013 to 
2015, encompassing 520 observations. 
Secondly, the "condition" column exhibits a mean 
of approximately 33.51 and a standard deviation 
of 15.30, indicating a range of condition ratings. 
Thirdly, the "odometer" column displays a mean 
of around 25,013.95 miles with a substantial 
standard deviation of 44,963.40 miles, 
suggesting significant variability in mileage. 
Fourthly, the "mmr" column has a mean of 
approximately 22,953.32 and a standard 
deviation of 12,469.64, highlighting diverse 
market values. Lastly, the "selling price" column 
presents a mean of around 22,290.20, with a 
standard deviation of 12,402.36. The price range 
extends from $2,500 to $77,250, underscoring 
the considerable variation in prices. 
The histogram provides a visual representation of 
the distribution of selling prices for cars in the 
dataset, utilizing 20 bins to segment the data. The 
dataset displays a wide range of selling prices, 
from $2,500 to $77,250, indicating a wide range 
of prices within the market. The histogram's 
shape indicates a right-skewed distribution, 
suggesting a higher proportion of cars are located 
at the lower end of the price spectrum. The 
skewness indicates a higher prevalence of 
affordable cars, while the histogram indicates that 
most cars are priced below $30,000.
The line graph illustrates the selling price trends 
over time, depicting fluctuations and variations in 
car prices across different years. Selling prices 
range from $2,500 to $77,250, with a median of 
approximately $21,250. The plot highlights 
fluctuations in selling prices over the years, with 
some years experiencing higher average selling 
prices compared to others. Further analysis could 
explore factors influencing these variations, such 
as changes in demand, economic conditions, or 
new car introductions. 
The correlation matrix reveals relationships 
between variables in the dataset. It shows a 
moderate positive correlation (0.261) between 
car condition and selling price, suggesting well
maintained cars fetch higher prices. Additionally, 
there is a moderate positive correlation (0.197) 
between the year of manufacture and selling 
price, indicating newer cars tend to have slightly 
higher prices. A weak negative correlation (
0.185) exists between odometer reading and 
selling price, implying higher mileage leads to 
slightly lower prices. Lastly, a strong positive 
correlation (0.978) is observed between 
Manheim Market Report (MMR) values and 
selling price, indicating higher MMR values 
correspond strongly with higher prices.
 
The correlation heatmap visually represents 
relationships between numerical variables. The 
correlation coefficient is displayed in each cell, 
with warmer colors indicating positive 
correlations and cooler colors indicating negative 
ones. 
 The year of manufacture correlates moderately 
positively (0.204) with selling price, implying 
newer cars tend to fetch higher prices. Car 
condition exhibits a strong positive correlation 
(0.353) with price, suggesting better condition 
commands higher prices. Odometer reading 
shows a moderate positive correlation (0.501) 
with price, indicating lower mileage correlates 
with higher prices. The Manheim Market Report 
(MMR) displays a strong positive correlation 
(0.708) with price, indicating higher MMR values 
are linked to higher selling prices. 
This report offers valuable insights into the 
dynamics of car pricing, highlighting the influence 
of various factors on selling prices. Further 
analysis and exploration could delve deeper into 
specific aspects of the dataset to gain additional 
insights into the car market.
